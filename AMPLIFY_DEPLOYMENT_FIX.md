# 🚀 AWS Amplify Deployment Fix Guide

## 🚨 Issue Identified
**Domain**: https://main.diwv3sayephw0.amplifyapp.com
**Problem**: Missing dependencies causing build failure

## ✅ Root Cause Found
Your React components use these packages that were missing from package.json:
- `axios` - For API calls
- `lucide-react` - For icons (Send, MessageCircle, User, Bot, etc.)

## 🔧 SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### 1. ✅ Added Missing Dependencies
```bash
npm install axios lucide-react
```

### 2. ✅ Updated package.json
Now includes all required dependencies:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "axios": "^1.10.0",        ← ADDED
    "lucide-react": "^0.525.0", ← ADDED
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "react-scripts": "5.0.1",
    "web-vitals": "^2.1.4"
  }
}
```

### 3. ✅ Tested Build Locally
```bash
✅ Build completed successfully!
✅ index.html found
✅ static directory found  
✅ JavaScript files found
✅ CSS files found
```

### 4. ✅ Created Fixed Deployment Package
- File: `ncdhhs-frontend-FIXED.zip` (168KB)
- Contains: Working build with all dependencies

### 5. ✅ Updated amplify.yml
- Better error handling
- Detailed logging
- Proper verification steps

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS TO FIX DEPLOYMENT

### Option 1: Git-Based Deployment (Recommended)
If your code is in a Git repository:

1. **Commit the changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Add missing dependencies (axios, lucide-react)"
   git push
   ```

2. **Amplify will auto-deploy** the fixed version

### Option 2: Manual Upload (Quick Fix)
1. **Go to AWS Amplify Console**: https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/
2. **Find your app**: main.diwv3sayephw0.amplifyapp.com
3. **Click "Deploy updates"**
4. **Upload**: `ncdhhs-frontend-FIXED.zip`

### Option 3: Update Build Settings
1. **Go to Amplify Console** → Your App → Build Settings
2. **Replace build specification** with the updated `amplify.yml` content
3. **Redeploy**

## 🔍 Environment Variables to Set

In Amplify Console → Environment Variables:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL = http://ncdhhs-pdf-qa-dev-alb-940310890.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT = production
REACT_APP_VERSION = 4.0.0
CI = false
DISABLE_ESLINT_PLUGIN = true
```

## 🧪 Verification Steps

After deployment, check:
1. **App loads**: https://main.diwv3sayephw0.amplifyapp.com/
2. **No console errors** in browser developer tools
3. **Icons display** properly (from lucide-react)
4. **API calls work** (axios integration)

## 📋 Files Ready for Deployment

- ✅ `ncdhhs-frontend-FIXED.zip` - Working build package
- ✅ `amplify.yml` - Updated build configuration  
- ✅ `package.json` - Fixed dependencies
- ✅ `AMPLIFY_DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md` - This guide

## 🎉 Expected Result

After applying this fix:
- ✅ Build will succeed
- ✅ App will load at https://main.diwv3sayephw0.amplifyapp.com/
- ✅ All components will work properly
- ✅ Icons and API calls will function

## 🚨 If Still Having Issues

1. **Check Amplify Console logs** for specific error messages
2. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
3. **Try manual upload** with the FIXED zip file
4. **Contact support** with build log details

The main issue was definitely the missing dependencies. This fix should resolve the deployment failure!
