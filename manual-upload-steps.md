## üîç What to Check After Deployment

### 1. Build Logs
- Check the build logs in Amplify Console
- Look for any error messages
- Verify all files were uploaded correctly

### 2. Test URLs
Once deployed, test these URLs (replace with your actual domain):
- `https://your-domain.amplifyapp.com/` - Should show the main app
- `https://your-domain.amplifyapp.com/static/js/main.*.js` - Should load JavaScript
- `https://your-domain.amplifyapp.com/static/css/main.*.css` - Should load CSS

### 3. Browser Developer Tools
- Open browser developer tools (F12)
- Check Console tab for JavaScript errors
- Check Network tab for failed requests
- Look for 404 errors on static files

## üö® Common Issues and Solutions
